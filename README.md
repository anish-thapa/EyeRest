## ‚ú® Features

-   **Immersive Fullscreen Overlay:** A non-intrusive but unmissable overlay appears when it's time for a break, with a simple and clear message.

-   **Intelligent Audio Control:** A custom sound plays to alert you, and it stops immediately if you choose to skip the break.
-   **"Start with Windows" Option:** A simple checkbox allows the app to launch automatically every time you log in.
